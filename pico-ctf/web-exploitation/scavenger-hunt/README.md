This problem was taken from the picoCTF 2021 and the solution will be discussed below. So proceed with caution.

Opening the link we are redirected to this simple website.

Let's view the page source of this website to understand more. Right click the page and left click **View Page Source** in the browser. **view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/**

Here we find the first part of the flag : `picoCTF{t`

Now let's check the other files stated by the page as being used to create the website. 

Let's start with `mycss.css` **view-source:http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/mycss.css**

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11 08 42 PM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/e6db29b0-4804-40b7-ab06-da6985ca6a1a)

We find the second part of the flag : `h4ts_4_l0`

Next file we need to inspect is `myjs.js`  **http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/myjs.js**

Although we are not able to find any flag, we find a clue to the next flag.  **How can I keep Google from indexing my website?**

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11 44 33 PM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/435d0469-487a-4954-b41e-18d33e277288)


Doing a Google search we find that `robots.txt` is used to prevent indexing. 

http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/robots.txt

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11 11 03 PM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/3042eb14-03ca-44a3-92dc-9cabde0bc1b7)

`robots.txt` is important in security as this can lead to information leak on what are restricted area on the site. This assist hackers in mapping the site. This file can lead to vulnerability if an area is listed to be restricted for crawling/indexing yet proper security protection are not implemented

We find the third part of the flag : `t_0f_pl4c`.

But the flag is still incomplete. The `robots.txt` file provides us a clue for the file containing the next part of the flag. **I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?**

For some reason the **Access** is capitalized in the clue. So let's start with doing a google lookup for *apache file access*. **How can I keep Google from indexing my website?**

https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11 22 55 PM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/c7291511-a11f-49f7-88a1-8eb3d22bdf5d)

So let's try accessing the `.htaccess` file. http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/.htaccess

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11 24 44 PM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/d3fdec04-a636-439e-ae89-7c0c43b5effa)

The file exists. This file is important security wise as misconfiguration of this file will lead to vulnerabilities. This file is used to control access to files, folders and access to IP addresses. 

We find the fourth flag: `3s_2_lO0k` along with the next clue for the file **I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.**

Again using google to search for the clue. We find that in Mac system there is a file called as `.DS_Store`

Let's try to access the file  http://mercury.picoctf.net:55079/.DS_Store

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 11 30 04 PM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/9dc9f88c-ebe7-4736-82cf-6948f13eebb8)

We find the last part of the flag : `_74cceb07}`

`.DS_Store` is significant in security as this can be used by hackers to see private files. This file stores custom  attributes/metadata of its containing folder and the name of other files around. 

It is known to be exploited by hackers to gain access to an admin portal, backend and database of an application to anyone that accessed the .DS_Store file. 

As this file is hidden, don't make the mistake of uploading the file along with your public web files. 

Combining every part of the flag we found: 

**Flag: picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_74cceb07}**

Until next time. Keep learning.

Stay stoked and code. :)
