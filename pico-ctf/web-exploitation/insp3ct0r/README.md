This problem was taken from the picoCTF 2021 and the solution will be discussed below. So proceed with caution.

This one is fairly straightforward. 

Opening the link we are redirected to a website showing the following:

Investigating the site we naturally look at the source code. Right click the page and left click **View Page Source** in the browser.

Here we find out that the html part has the first part of the flag. Flag 1/3: `picoCTF{tru3_d3`

Looking at the **How** tab of the website it mentions that it used html, css, js to create the site.

We have seen the html part. Now let's look at the css part. Just open the `mycss.css` and `myjs.js` link in the source page we have opened before.

The second part of the flag can be found at `mycss.css`.  Flag 2/3: `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t`

The last part of the flag can be found at `myjs.js`. Flag 3/3: `_lucky?f10be399}`

![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 12 49 09 AM](https://github.com/niccololampa/cyber-security-notes/assets/37615906/0c40ba91-7be1-4dd9-b9ff-f6bd190f0aeb)

Combining all the parts we get the full flag. 

**Flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}**


Until next time. Keep learning.

Stay stoked and code. :)
